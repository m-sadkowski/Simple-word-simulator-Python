# The World Simulation (Python Version with Pygame)

This is the **Python implementation** of **The World Simulation**, built using the **Pygame** library. It simulates a virtual ecosystem with diverse animals, unique abilities, and a human character controlled by the user. This version retains the core OOP principles of the original project while leveraging Python's simplicity and Pygame's graphical capabilities.
